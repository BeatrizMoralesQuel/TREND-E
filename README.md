# TREND-E: Empowering the Fashion Industry with Instagram Trends

# Project Overview

This project centers around an in-depth analysis of products sold by Asos, comparing them to prevailing fashion trends on the popular social platform, Instagram.

# Objective

Our primary goal is to discern and leverage fashion trends prevalent on Instagram, enabling us to incorporate them into clothing selection or production processes through a cutting-edge "trendy" recommender program/application.

# Motivation and Purpose

Historically, fashion companies relied on trendsetters and globe-trotting trend hunters to guide their production. However, in recent times, data-driven decision-making has revolutionized the fashion landscape.

I aspire for my findings, ideas, and insights to empower other companies to grasp the potential of this innovative production strategy.

# Data Sources

This project draws data from two key sources:

- **Instagram** using scraping techniques, we harvested relevant hashtags and quantified their usage.

- **Asos** E-Commerce Dataset, accessible on **Kaggle**, forms the core of the project's analysis.

# Methodology and Code

- Programming Language: Python
- User Interface: StreamLit

# Conclusions

Through the development of two distinct machine learning models – a regression model for predicting hashtag counts and a clustering model to categorize products with shared attributes – we aim to guide users toward "trendy" clothing choices for production or inclusion in their shop catalog. This innovative approach promises to revolutionize the fashion industry's decision-making processes.
